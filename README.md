# Ignite React Projects

This repository contains six projects developed during the React track of the Ignite course by Rocketseat. The projects cover different aspects of React development, from the fundamentals to more advanced topics like performance optimization and design systems.

**Note**: This project is currently a work in progress. Only the first project is currently in progress. The other projects have not been started yet.

## Project 01 - "Fundamentos do ReactJS" (In Progress)

In this module, I will develop a React application using Vite, while delving into some of the most fundamental concepts of React. These include componentization, properties, states, immutability, and hooks. Additionally, I will employ TypeScript to introduce static typing to my project. By the end of this project, I will have gained a solid foundation in React development that will enable me to create complex and scalable applications.
